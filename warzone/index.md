Warzone
========

The warzone is an isolated network simulating the entire IPv4 Internet, on
which all connected devices are targets to be hacked. Unlike other wargames,
the warzone allows players to connect their own hackable servers or devices
with any software they like, as long as it speaks IP.

The warzone setup gives us the ability to create wargames that are far more
interesting than the ones currently online, such as a games based on
Windows/Android/<enter wacky OS here>, kernel exploitation, advanced network
exploitation, etc.

Currently, we are gathering feedback on the warzone to help steer its development.

{% include beginNote.html title="WARNING" %}
The warzone is an experimental network without any protection. Just like on the
real Internet, your computer is exposed to attacks.  If you connect to the
warzone, use adequate protection (e.g. a firewall).
{% include endNote.html %}

To make the place more interesting, we have created a setup (named tsutomu)
that encourages you to recreate the Mitnick Attack in real life.  More
information on tsutomu can be be found at <http://172.16.123.4> once you are
connected to the warzone.

To get access to the warzone, join the #warzone channel on ircs.overthewire.org (SSL)
and request access.

You may find it helpful to coordinate in the #warzone channel with others working on
tsutomu, to avoid getting in each others way.
