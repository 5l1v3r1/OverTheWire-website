Warzone
========

The warzone is an isolated network simulating the entire IPv4 Internet, on
which all connected devices are targets to be hacked. Unlike other wargames,
the warzone allows players to connect their own hackable servers or devices
with any software they like, as long as it speaks IP.

The warzone setup gives us the ability to create wargames that are far more
interesting than the ones currently online, such as a games based on
Windows/Android/<enter wacky OS here>, kernel exploitation, advanced network
exploitation, etc.
