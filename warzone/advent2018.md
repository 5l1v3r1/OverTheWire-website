Advent Bonanza 2018 CTF
=======================

OverTheWire organized the OverTheWire Advent Bonanza 2018 CTF in December 2018.
Just like in an advent calendar, which gives one chocolate per day between 1 and 25 December,
this CTF released one challenge per day as well.

The CTF VM is now hosted in the warzone to give everyone a chance to play the challenges
at their own pace.

The results of the CTF can be found on [CTFTime.org].
Congratulations to the top 3 winners: kainashi, Tasteless and WTFH4X!
